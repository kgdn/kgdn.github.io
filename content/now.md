This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about) which is a page that tells you what I'm up to right now.

Currently working on improving my dissertation project, Buffet, which is a web application that allows users to test various GNU/Linux distributions in a web browser. The project has already been submitted for assessment, but I'm continuing to work on it to improve the user experience and add new features.

It will be available on GitHub soon, under the permissive and open-source GNU Affero General Public License v3.0, pending grading.
