This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about) which is a page that tells you what I'm up to right now.

I received the mark for my dissertation and other modules, and will be graduating from Heriot-Watt University on the 19th of June with a First Class honours degree in BSc. Computer Systems. Shortly after this post goes live, I will be open sourcing Buffet, the project I made as a part of my dissertation.
