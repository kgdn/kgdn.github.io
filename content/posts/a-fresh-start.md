Alright, let's do this one more time. Hello! I'm Kieran, and this is my blog. I had a blog before, hosted on this same domain, but I decided to start fresh. I've learned a lot since I started that blog, and I wanted to start anew with a fresh perspective. So, here we are. Let's talk about what you can expect from this blog.

## What to Expect
Firstly, I'm going to be writing about a lot of different things. At the time of this writing, I'll be finishing up my degree in Computer Systems at Heriot-Watt University, so you can expect some posts about that. I'm also interested in a lot of other things, like programming, GNU/Linux, and more, so you can expect posts about those topics as well. I'll also be writing about my personal life, like what I'm up to right now, so you can get to know me a bit better.

## What's Next
On this website, you can find links to all of my posts, projects, and more. I'll be updating this site regularly, so be sure to check back often. You can also follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/kgdn) to see what I'm working on. I'm always working on something, so there should be plenty of new content to see. If RSS is more your thing, you can subscribe to my feed [here](/index.xml).

## Wrapping Up
I'm excited to start this new blog and share my thoughts and experiences with you. I hope you enjoy reading my ramblings as much as I enjoy writing them. With that said, I'll see you in the next post. Until then, take care!
