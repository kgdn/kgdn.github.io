Hi, I'm Kieran. I'm a recent graduate from Heriot-Watt University with a degree in Computer Systems. I'm interested in all things computing, from operating systems like GNU/Linux to programming languages like Python, TypeScript and more. 

I made this blog as a way to share my thoughts and experiences with others. I hope you enjoy reading my ramblings as much as I enjoy writing them.
